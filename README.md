# souvik-dynamic-form-with-backend-MERN-STACK-
I made this form with dynamic fields fetched with a json data. You can also submit a form and see the submitted forms in the submitted forms page. You can also edit the form and delete the form if you want. The front end is made with react and backend is made with node/express/mongo db
